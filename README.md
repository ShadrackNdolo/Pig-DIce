## Description
This is a game web application that displays a list of scores i.e when two players take turns to play and roll one die.

The program should retain the current players score if they choose to hold.
- Input : Clicking on the hold button
- Output : Possible values displayed. [1,2,3,4,5,6]

The program should change a players score to 0 if they land one the die value of 1.
- Current value: 6
- Input : Click on roll and the displayed value is 1.
- Output :  [0] 

The program should allow the pair a maximum of 6 consecutive turns.
- Input : One of the players clicks on roll for 6 times.
- Output : The turn is given to the next player.
